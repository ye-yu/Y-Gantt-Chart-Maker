# Y-Gantt-Chart-Maker
Simple Gantt Chart Maker using Python and Microsoft Excel File

This is my first repository on GitHub and I will be using Python 3.x to programme this Gantt Chart Maker.
I am using openpyxl module for the communication between Python and Microsoft Excel File and Qt for the GUI of my programme.
The 'Resource' folder contains the template of Microsoft Excel File that is pre-programmed with Macro to display the Gantt Chart.
